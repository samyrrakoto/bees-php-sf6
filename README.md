# Technical test: Bees by Samyr Rakoto for Thalasseo
+ /!\ Requires PHP 8.1 as it uses some of the latest features, like the attributes and the read-only properties.
+ First `git clone`the repository.
+ Then execute a `composer install`.
+ Launch the PHP Symfony web server : `symfony serve`.
+ Open the default localhost + port on your favorite browser once the server is successfully lauched : [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
+ Have all the fun you want killing random bees.
+ The game restarts automatically when the Queen dies.
+ You can also start a fresh new game anytime by clicking `RESET`.
+ When you're done hitting those poor bees, should you want to run unit tests, be my guest : just execute `./bin/phpunit`.
